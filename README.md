ℹ️ Overview

ViralSense is an AI-driven social media intelligence platform that helps users understand what is going viral, why it’s spreading, and how people feel about it — in real time.

In today’s fast-moving digital ecosystem, manually tracking trends, public sentiment, and online conversations is nearly impossible. ViralSense solves this by aggregating live data from multiple sources such as social media posts, comments, and news headlines using APIs. This data is then analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI to extract actionable insights.
